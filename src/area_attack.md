# Area attack

2-4 players compete to claim the most area on a single board. 

## Area

A player's area is defined as the region of the board encompassing the cells which the player has
uncovered. The state of a cell contained in a player's area is not visible to opponents, except for
that the cell is owned in that area. 

## Penalty

When a player uncovers a mine, they are penalized by being frozen for some time. In this time, the
player is not given any new information about the board and not allowed to execute any new actions.
On the other hand, opponents will be able to see that the player is frozen. After the player is
unfrozen, the mine will be revealed on the board.
