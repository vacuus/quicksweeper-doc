# Gamemodes

* [**Classic singleplayer**](./singleplayer.md)

A single player plays locally in order to clear a board without time constraint. Relevant statistics
include time and combo score.

* [**Area attack**](./area_attack.md)

Multiple players clear mines on the same board, claiming all areas they themselves have cleared.
Dying penalizes the players for a short time, and the game ends either on a timer or when the board
is clear. Players are then ranked based on the amount of cells cleared.

* [**Score attack**](./score_attack.md)

Two players on separate boards play against each other to gain the best score. When a player fails
too many times, the game ends for them and they must wait until the other player finishes in order
to have their scores compared. The player with the greatest score wins.
