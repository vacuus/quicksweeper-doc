# Score attack

Two players compete against each other to get the greatest possible score within some time. Details
about how score is awarded can be found in [Scoring](./scoring.md)

## Lives and boards

When starting, both players are given a board, and select a position to begin in. When both players
have selected a position, the game begins and a timer starts. When a player has cleared a board,
they will be presented with a blank one of the same size. The timer will not pause for the player
who had cleared a board.

If a player reveals a mine, then their board is replaced with a new one, similar to if it were
cleared. The timer also will not pause for this event.
